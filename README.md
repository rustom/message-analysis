# CS 410 Final Project: Text Message Sentiment Analysis

Name: Rustom Ichhaporia

netID: rustomi2

## Project Description

This project is a text message sentiment analysis tool. It parses  your personal text messages from iMessage as well as your text messages from Facebook Messenger, computes the sentiment of the texts, and outputs some interesting plots and statistics related to these sentiments. 

## How to Run

All of the code for this project is contained in the `exploration.ipynb` notebook. 

### iMessage Data

To query your iMessage data, you must have a computer running MacOS. You shouldn't need to do any extra work to get the code running, unless you need to give the code permission to access your iMessage files in the settings when prompted. 

### Facebook Messenger Data

To query your Facebook Messenger data, you must go to your Facebook account settings and download your data. You can find the instructions for [downloading your Facebook data here](https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644). This will be downloadable in the form of multiple folders labeled `your_activity_across_facebook`. I recommend copying these folders into a new folder called `facebook_data` in the same directory as the `exploration.ipynb` notebook. The notebook will handle the rest. 

## Questions

If you have any questions on how to run the code, or run into any issues, please feel free to open an issue on this repository. Thank you!
