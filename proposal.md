# CS 410 Project Proposal

Author/Captain: Rustom Ichhaporia (netID: rustomi2)

## Description

I plan to conduct a sentiment analysis on my personal text messages from different platforms. 



### Datasets

I plan to use a combination of my messages from Google Hangouts (accessible via Google Takeout), Apple iMessage, and Facebook Messenger. I may not end up using all three sources based on the difficulty of extracting the individual text information from each source. As a fallback plan, I can connect to the Twitter API and use tweets about text messages as a dataset.


What is your free topic? Please give a detailed description. What is the task? Why is it important or interesting? What is your planned approach? What tools, systems or datasets are involved? What is the expected outcome? How are you going to evaluate your work?
Which programming language do you plan to use?
Please justify that the workload of your topic is at least 20*N hours, N being the total number of students in your team. You may list the main tasks to be completed, and the estimated time cost for each task.
